# PyBer Qtr 1 Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
A friend at Pyber as given us the task of utilizing Python & Pandas to analyze their January – April fares. It was request that we show the fare of each city type by week. I manipulated this data and calculated the average fares through code. Then, by graphing this data I’ve amplified the differences by city type, which can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. I used the object=oriented interface method to plot my graph.

## Results:
