# PyBer Qtr 1 Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
A friend at Pyber as given us the task of utilizing Python & Pandas to analyze their January – April fares. It was request that we show the fare of each city type by week. I manipulated this data and calculated the average fares through code. Then, by graphing this data I’ve amplified the differences by city type, which can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. I used the object=oriented interface method to plot my graph.

## Results:

## Breakoutdown by type:
### Urban
Urban fares are by fare the highest. They are nearly double that of Suburban wages, and almost 10x that of Rural fares in total prices. You’ll find there are 2400+ drivers in the Urban areas ready to pick up drivers compared to the average of 78 drivers in Rural areas. Yet, on average the far per Driver is actaully significantly less. User wise, its cheaper to get a ride in the city. Driver wise, it’s easier to get paid in country-country rural areas. 
### Suburban
The PyBer sweet spot. The happy median when it comes to drivers and users finding their needs, and this would be a demographic to focus marketing on. They average $30 per ride and have an average of 490 drivers. There rides per total drivers than both Rural & Urban communities. It may not bring it as much money as the Urban type, but it is a stable market to build a community of drivers and users in.
### Rural
The Rural community is not the shining highlight of this analysis. However, it provides great insight into how all 3 communities work in comparison to each other. This highlights where Pyber should focus marketing strategies and where most of their users are located. While the rural area may not have the most drivers, the best return or the lowest fares, it does have the highest average fare per driver. This is great to advertise to your drivers who want the extra buck and are in the area. Or even want to make more money in a faster time. 

## Summary:
Overall, I’s say there are some promising business opportunities for PyBer presented by this data. For one, we already see the disparity in almost every category for type rural fares. So, we recommend not to focus a huge part of your business here. But use it as a tool to get drivers in. With the highest average per driver, promoting this stat will reach a crowd looking to make money fast on Pyber. Secondly, I recommend spending Pyber time and money on marketing User wise in Urban communities. User wise, incentivizes would get people downtown needing rides, and they will be more likely to use an PyBer. This demographic is the most consistent with using the app, which is consistent money. Take advantage of the huge surges of people on the weakened, and event nights. My last recommendation is to focus your primary marketing team on your core Driving & User community, Suburbia. They are the most consistent and which is consistent money. Focus your primary marketing team on your core Driving & User community, Suburbia.
